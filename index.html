                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to
                    make a website
                    function,
                    efficient.
                    I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS.
                    I even know
                    the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made
                    their website
                    and
                    showed it
                    to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
